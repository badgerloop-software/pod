The embedded repository for Badgerloop's pod in the Hyperloop Competition

## Local Make Instructions

To build or clean all compile targets using the Bash script:

```
./deploy.sh build
```

```
./deploy.sh clean
```

To build all compile targets manually:

1) Make a directory called build in the root of the repository and enter it

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

2) Run cmake on the parent directory 

```
cmake ..
```

3) Build the project with make

```
make
```

## Running the Executables

All executable targets are placed in the `out` directory after a successful build.

The main badgerloop executable will be placed in `out/badgerloop`

A build to run all GTest Unit & Component Tests will be placed in `out/run_all_tests`

Deprecated non-GTest examples & tests can be found under `out/tests`

## Cross-Compilation Make Instructions

To install the toolchain needed for cross-compiling:

```
sudo ./deploy.sh cross-setup
```

Then, to build the executable:

```
./deploy.sh cross
```


### Adding Tests

BadgerLoop uses [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit and component testing. A detailed introduction to GTest is available [here](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md). Tests should be placed within a respective folder under the `Test` directory. Be sure to add to a new file to the respective CMakeLists.txt file if necessary.

 ### Structural Conventions
 
 In order to ensure the program is built and linked correctly, there are a couple basic rules that should be followed. 
 
  1. Only .c and .cpp files should live in any given `src/` directory, and only .h files belong in the `include/` directories. Any other supporting files (e.g. READMEs) belong in at least one level above `src/` and `include/`. 
  2. The only source files containing a `main()` function should live either in `pod/embedded/app/main` or in any of the examples subdirectories. 
  3. Only one source file should live in the `pod/embedded/app/main` directory: `badgerloop.cpp`. If any other code is placed there it will either link incorrectly or fail to be compiled at all.
  
### Coding Conventions

- camelCase for function names and local variable names
- ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES for #defines and constants
- Make any function that will not be part of the API (helper functions) `static` so that it stays local to that file
- Avoid magic numbers and string constants when at all possible
- Comment on any parts of your code that could be considered difficult to understand at a glance
- Add comments on top of functions that are going to be a part of the interface others use to interact with your code
- Avoid global variables if possible
